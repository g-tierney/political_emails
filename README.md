# Political Emails

I signed up for every 2018 Senate campaign email list that I could and analyzed the messages in various ways. The data are cleaned and parsed from gmail's .mbox format. The raw .mbox file contains every email the account recieved, not all of which are used in the analysis. "2018 Races.xlsx" has the information I gave to each campaign and the date I signed up for each campaign. It also contains the crosswalk between email addresses and campaigns. load_and_clean.R creates emails_simple.csv, which is used in the writeup.rmd file to produce the analysis.
