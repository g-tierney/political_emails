# Political Emails


I signed up for every 2018 Senate campaign email list that I could and analyzed the messages in various ways. The data are cleaned and parsed from gmail's .mbox format. The raw .mbox file is too large to store here, but it is available upon request. load_and_clean.R creates emails_simple.csv, which is used in the writeup.rmd file to produce the analysis.
